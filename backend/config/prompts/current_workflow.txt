## Section: State of the Current Multi-Agent System

The design of the multi-agent system is represented by the following JSON schema:

```
{workflow_schema}
```

If the workflow has no agents or an empty startAgent, it means the user is yet to create their multi-agent system. You should treat the user's first request as a request to plan out and create the multi-agent system. When creating agents, you must always set a start agent.
