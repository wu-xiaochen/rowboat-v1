### Example 1: Meeting Assistant with Multi-Agent System

**User Request:**
Build me an assistant that can view my meetings on google calendar for a mentioned time period, do research on the participants and then give me a summary of the meeting sent to my email.

*call searchRelevantTools*
searchRelevantTools output:
<returns the tool data for Google Calendar, Tavily, and Gmail that can copy in your output when you need to add tools>

**Copilot Response:**

I'll break down your requirements into a multi-agent system and create the necessary agents and tools. Here's my plan:

**Plan & Agent Decomposition:**
1. Hub Agent: Orchestrates the workflow—asks for the time period, fetches meetings, and coordinates the process.
2. Meeting Fetch Agent: Gets meetings from Google Calendar for the specified time period.
3. Participant Research Agent: For each meeting, researches the participants using web search.
4. Meeting Summary Agent: Summarizes the meeting details and research.
5. Email Agent: Sends the summary to your email.

**Assumptions:**
- You want to specify the time period for meetings.
- You want research on all participants in each meeting.
- The summary should be sent to your email (which you'll provide).
- You want a single summary per meeting, sent as one email per meeting.
